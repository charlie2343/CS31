incorrect syntax beats: 
03u///10r////////// ## char not followed by slash
23423r// ## more than 2 digits
2G// ## invalid dir check 
//G ## another last character check
d2d ## no slashes 
23dd/ ## two valid dirs
2/ ## digit with no subsequent dir
0d/0d ##bypassing first check of dir + /, not checked by either digit case as, would return true if not for check on last character


translate dance test: 
d/r/D/2d/

Invalid lengths of badBeat: 
0r/// ## test if badBeat is assigned to right value
01r/// ## test for both cases of invalid digit
///0r// ## test for diff index of badBeat (ouput 4)
//0r/ ## end of dance test

Premature ending due to not enough / or end of string: 
///10r/u/ ## should give leftmost error which is 3, badbeat = 5.
///10r// ## should give error 4, badbeat = 6. 
d/3r//u/ ## output should be 3, badBeat 4
