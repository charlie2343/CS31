It always does seem to me that I am
doingmore work than I should  do. It is not
thatI object to the work, mind you; I like
work:it fascinates  me. I can sit and look
atit for  hours. I love to keep it by
me:the idea of getting rid of it nearly
breaksmy  heart.

You cannot give me too much work; to
accumulatework has almost become a passion with
me:my study is so full of it now, that
thereis hardly an inch of room for anymore.
