It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than
  I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you;
I like work: it fascinates me.       I can sit and look at it for hours.
I love to keep     it by me: the idea of getting
rid
of it nearly breaks my heart. <P> You cannot give me too
much work; to accumulate work has almost become


a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly
an inch of room for any more.


Let's
    check    what
 happens.  <P>

Wow.

This is useful for Project 5 if you choose to process
the input character by character. Some people will use an approach that reads one line at a time into a C string:

getline 


DISCLAIMER: This is ONE way to do things we discussed, and there are multiple other ways to approach the problem!

I'd first read in the first "line" --> say there are parts of a word that's dangling.
--> As I iterate the line buffer, I'll check if any chars are not printed at the end.
--> if such chars exist, I'll store in the portion buffer (you want to be careful how you set the "prev chars" & "portion lenth")
--> and then you do the next getline, which may include portions of the last word from the previous getline (which you'll have in the portion buffer)
--> you check if there are any pre-existing chars (from the previous read) in the portion buffer. If so, then (after checking for some conditions)
you would either append the remaining chars of that word as you go through your new line buffer.



portion = buffer for word
